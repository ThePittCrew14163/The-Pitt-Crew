                <h4>Our Members</h4>
                <p>Our team has six members. Five returning members, and one new. Our team is made up of 100% homeschooled students from North Carolina, and we've all learned a lot since we started participating in FTC!</p>

                <h4>Our Robot&nbsp;</h4>
                <p>This year our robot had to launch orange, foam rings into an elevated goal. Our robot uses fast spinning wheels on the front to pull in the rings, and a large ring that shoots the rings into the goal. The large ring is on a motor which turns to automatically aim towards the goal.</p>

                <h4>Our Experience</h4>
                <p>This is our third year in FIRST. We've learned how to program robots to move, determin where objects are around itself, and know its own position, we've learned how to build a robot that aims and shoots acuratly, stacks blocks on top of each other, intakes rings and much more. In just three years in FIRST we've learned so many skills!</p>

                <h4>Our Awards</h4>
                <p>Our team has earned many awards from the tournaments we've atteneded. We've won an award for entering the best paper explaining our code, an award for making the best video responding to a prompt related to FIRST or FTC, and last but not least we won first place at a tournament our second year!</p>
