				<h4>Outreach&nbsp;</h4>
				<p>FIRST has given us an amazing experience these last couple years so we have done our best to tell others about it too. We displayed our robot at a local fair where 300+ people possibly saw our booth, talked about our experience at schools, co-ops and hosted a yard sale where we shared our experience with FIRST. If you want to learn more about FIRST visit their website at https://www.firstinspires.org</p>
